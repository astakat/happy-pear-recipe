# **Instructions:**

To prepare the broth, first put the veg stock and 2.5 tbsp tamari together with the grated ginger, the juice of 1 lime and 1 tbsp of maple syrup into a suitable sized pan and bring to the boil.

Tear/chop the mushrooms into bite-sized pieces.
Put a pan on a high heat, once hot add the mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes stirring regularly (if it starts to stick add 1 tsp of water).

Mix 3 tbsp tamari, the 3 tbsp water, juice of 1 lime and the 1 tbsp maple syrup in a bowl and add to the mushrooms. Cook for 2 minutes or until most of the sauce has been absorbed.

Once your broth (veg stock with other bits) is boiling, reduce to a simmer and add the noodles and cook as per instructions on the back of the packet.

In the meantime, you can start preparing the toppings: de-seed and finely chop the red chilli, together with the scallion greens. Grate the carrot and wash your bean sprouts in a colander.

Once noodles are cooked, spoon them out with a slotted spoon or tongs, dividing between 4 deep bowls. Ladle out the broth and pour equal amounts into each bowl, so that the noodles are just covered.

Now, layer your ramen with the toppings: bean sprouts and the grated carrot on each side of each bowl, topped with the chopped scallions and chilli in the centre.

Finally, add the mushrooms right in the centre and sprinkle with some sesame seeds and serve. Enjoy!

Tip: To take your ramen to the next level, add some dried seaweed (eg. arami) and 2 tbsp of miso into your broth, fresh coriander and/or pickled ginger/sauerkraut to garnish.
